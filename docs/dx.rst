Direct Connect Use Case
=======================

Potentially reduced network cost
--------------------------------
If you have bandwidth-heavy workloads that you wish to run in AWS, AWS Direct Connect reduces your network costs into and out of AWS in two ways. First, by transferring data to and from AWS directly, you can reduce your bandwidth commitment to your Internet service provider. Second, all data transferred over your dedicated connection is charged at the reduced AWS Direct Connect data transfer rate rather than Internet data transfer rates.

Private Connectivity to your Amazon VPC
---------------------------------------
You can use AWS Direct Connect to establish a private or transit virtual interface from your on-premise network directly to your Amazon VPC, providing you with a private, high bandwidth network conenction between your network and your VPC. With multiple private virtual interfaces or a single transit virtual interface, you can even establish private connectivity to multiple VPCs.

Compatible with most of the Public AWS Services
-----------------------------------------------
AWS Direct Connect is a network service and works with most of the AWS services that are accessible over the Internet, such as Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3), Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) and Public IPs assigned to resources in Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC).

Elastic
-------
AWS Direct Connect makes it easy to scale your connection to meet your needs. AWS Direct Connect provides 1 Gbps and 10 Gbps connections and you can easily provision multiple connections if you need more capacity. You can also use AWS Direct Connect instead of establishing a VPN connection over the Internet to your Amazon VPC to have consistent network performance.

Consistent Network performance
------------------------------
Network latency over the Internet can vary given that the Internet is constantly changing how data get from point A to B. With AWS Direct Connect, you choose the data utilises the dedicated connection and how that data is routed which can provide a more consisten network experience over Internet-based connections.

Low latency, high performance
